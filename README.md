It has only x-coordinate movement. Using only a UV sensor for now. Trying to get an accelarometer to get the 2D movement. 
I am using a rapberry pi to detect the movement of the finger whichever one you are wearing the sensor. It detects the left and right movement and sends it to the PC through python sever.
Python server uses pyautogui to control the cursor. Button provided to stimualate single click and double click.

# H2 Ver 2.0
